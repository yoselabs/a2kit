# health-probe Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change a2web-feedback-round-2. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: User-registered readiness checks

The system SHALL allow registering health checks via `@app.health_check` that run when the health tool is invoked and aggregate into the response.

#### Scenario: passing check contributes ok entry

- **WHEN** `@app.health_check` is registered for a function returning `HealthResult.ok()` and the health tool runs
- **THEN** the response `checks` list contains an entry with that function's `__name__` and `status="ok"`

#### Scenario: failing check flips overall status to degraded

- **WHEN** any registered check returns `HealthResult.fail("sqlite missing")`
- **THEN** the response `status` is `"degraded"` and the corresponding `checks` entry has `reason="sqlite missing"`

### Requirement: Hidden from tool listings by default

The system SHALL exclude `_meta.health` from agent-facing `list_tools` output by default.

#### Scenario: list_tools omits the health tool

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `list_tools` without an opt-in flag
- **THEN** the returned list does not include `_meta.health`

#### Scenario: include_meta surfaces the health tool

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `list_tools` with the meta opt-in flag
- **THEN** the returned list includes `_meta.health` with its descriptor

### Requirement: CLI exit code reflects health

The auto-generated `<app> health` CLI subcommand SHALL exit with a non-zero status code when the aggregated health status is anything other than `"ok"`. The subcommand SHALL run without importing any pytest-dependent modules — specifically, the health command SHALL NOT import `a2kit.packages.testing` or any submodule that requires `pytest` at runtime. The probe SHALL execute by calling `a2kit.packages.health.run_checks(app)` directly under the App's `lifespan_cm()`, rendering the result as JSON to stdout.

#### Scenario: ok status exits zero

- **WHEN** all registered checks return `HealthResult.ok()` and the user runs `<app> health`
- **THEN** the command prints the aggregated JSON to stdout
- **AND** exits with code `0`

#### Scenario: degraded status exits non-zero

- **WHEN** any registered check returns `HealthResult.fail(...)` and the user runs `<app> health`
- **THEN** the command prints the aggregated JSON to stdout
- **AND** exits with a non-zero code

#### Scenario: `<app> health` works without pytest installed

- **GIVEN** a fresh virtual environment with the app's runtime dependencies installed and pytest NOT installed
- **WHEN** the user runs `<app> health`
- **THEN** the command runs to completion (no `ModuleNotFoundError: pytest`)
- **AND** prints the aggregated health JSON
- **AND** exits with the appropriate code

#### Scenario: health command does not import testing package

- **WHEN** the `<app> health` command path is exercised
- **THEN** `sys.modules` does not contain `a2kit.packages.testing` (nor any submodule thereof) at the moment `run_checks` is invoked

### Requirement: `_meta.*` namespace reserved

The system SHALL reject user tools whose name starts with `_meta.` at decoration or registration time.

#### Scenario: user tool with reserved name raises

- **WHEN** a user decorates a tool `@a2kit.read(name="_meta.custom")`
- **THEN** a `ValueError` is raised at decoration time, naming the reserved namespace

### Requirement: `_meta.health` SHALL install exclusively via `@app.health_check`

The synthetic `_meta.health` tool SHALL install as a side effect of
the first `@app.health_check` registration on an `App`. The install
SHALL be idempotent — subsequent `@app.health_check` calls SHALL
register additional checks without re-installing the synthetic
router. Apps with zero registered checks SHALL NOT have
`_meta.health` exposed; the synthetic router exists only when at
least one check exists.

The previous `App(health_tool=True)` install path SHALL NOT exist.
Constructing `App(...)` with that keyword SHALL raise `TypeError`
with a message naming `@app.health_check` as the replacement.

#### Scenario: First @app.health_check installs the synthetic tool

- **GIVEN** `app = a2kit.App("a")` (no checks yet)
- **WHEN** `@app.health_check` is applied to a function for the first time
- **THEN** `_meta.health` becomes invocable on the app's MCP/CLI surface
- **AND** `app.tools()` includes the synthetic tool descriptor

#### Scenario: Repeated @app.health_check is idempotent

- **GIVEN** an app with two `@app.health_check`-decorated functions registered
- **WHEN** the app is inspected
- **THEN** exactly one `_meta.health` tool descriptor exists
- **AND** both checks fire when `_meta.health` is invoked

#### Scenario: `health_tool=True` raises with migration hint

- **GIVEN** code `a2kit.App("a", health_tool=True)`
- **WHEN** the constructor evaluates
- **THEN** `TypeError` is raised
- **AND** the message contains `"health_check"`

#### Scenario: No checks → no synthetic tool

- **GIVEN** `app = a2kit.App("a")` with no `@app.health_check` registrations
- **WHEN** the app is inspected
- **THEN** `_meta.health` is NOT present in `app.tools()`
- **AND** invoking `_meta.health` over MCP returns the standard "unknown tool" error
